              <!-- Section 1: The Situation -->
              <h2 id="situation">The Situation</h2>
              <p>A 7 PM kickoff changes everything. Your tailgate starts around noon and doesn't wrap until midnight &mdash; maybe later if you're hanging around for post-game. That's 12 hours of eating, drinking, socializing, standing, cooking, and cheering. This isn't a sprint. This is an endurance event. And most people aren't built for it because they don't plan for it.</p>
              <p>The amateurs peak at 4 PM. They go hard on the food and drinks the moment they arrive, ride a wave of energy through the early afternoon, and then crater. By the time kickoff rolls around, they're sunburned, dehydrated, half-asleep, and wondering why they feel like they've been awake for three days. Some don't even make it into the stadium. Others stumble in and are asleep by the third quarter &mdash; missing the best part of the night game atmosphere that they waited all day for.</p>
              <p>Veterans pace like marathoners. They know the day has phases, and they manage their energy through each one. They eat real meals at planned intervals. They hydrate deliberately. They understand that the goal isn't to have the most fun at 2 PM &mdash; it's to still be standing, sharp, and fired up when the stadium lights come on and the crowd hits a roar at 7 PM. Night games reward patience and punish impatience, every single time.</p>

                <figcaption>Night games deliver the best atmosphere in sports &mdash; but only if you still have the energy to enjoy it.</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <!-- Section 2: What Changes -->
              <h2 id="what-changes">What Changes</h2>
              <p>The most obvious shift is food timing. A noon tailgate for a 1 PM game has one meal cycle: you cook, you eat, you go in. Night games demand two full meals. You need a substantial lunch spread when you arrive around noon, and you need a second cooking session between 4 and 5 PM to refuel before the game. One meal won't carry your crew for 12 hours, and snacking on chips from 2 to 7 PM isn't a food plan &mdash; it's a recipe for an energy crash.</p>
              <p>Lighting becomes essential. Around 5 PM, the sun starts dropping and your tailgate setup goes dark fast. If you haven't planned for this, you'll be grilling in shadows, tripping over coolers, and cleaning up by phone flashlight. String lights, LED lanterns, and battery-powered spotlights aren't luxury items at a night game &mdash; they're necessities. They also transform the vibe of your setup. A well-lit tailgate after dark creates an atmosphere that draws people in.</p>
              <p>Temperature is the sleeper variable. Even in September, the delta between 1 PM sun and 9 PM shade can be 20 degrees or more. People show up in shorts and t-shirts and are shivering by halftime. Layers are non-negotiable &mdash; a light jacket or hoodie stashed in the car is the minimum. Entertainment also needs to scale. A 3-hour pre-game is manageable with conversation and music. A 7-hour pre-game needs structure: cornhole tournaments, football toss, TVs showing the early games, card games, and music that evolves with the energy of the day.</p>

              <!-- Section 3: What Fails -->
              <h2 id="what-fails">What Fails</h2>
              <p>Drinking at noon pace and expecting to last until midnight is the number one night-game killer. It sounds obvious when you read it, but watch any night game parking lot at 6:30 PM and you'll see the wreckage. Groups that cracked their first beer at noon and never adjusted are done. They're argumentative, sloppy, or asleep in lawn chairs. The math doesn't work: 7+ hours of steady drinking wrecks even experienced drinkers. Pacing isn't optional for night games &mdash; it's the entire strategy.</p>
              <p>One-meal food plans fail spectacularly. The group that puts out a big lunch spread at noon and then has nothing for the next 6 hours is in trouble. By 4 PM, people are hungry again. By 5 PM, they're raiding the cooler for random snacks. By 6 PM, they're buying overpriced stadium food or just running on empty. Your crew can't sustain energy and good decision-making on a single meal over half a day. You need two deliberate food phases, and this needs to be planned before you leave the house.</p>
              <p>No lighting is the other silent failure. It doesn't seem like a big deal when you're setting up under midday sun, but by the time you're packing up at 10 or 11 PM, you'll be doing it blind. Cooking after 5 PM without a light source is genuinely dangerous &mdash; undercooked food, burns from grills you can't see clearly, and the general misery of stumbling around in a dark parking lot. Forgetting that temperatures drop after sunset, even in early fall, catches people every single time. And having absolutely nothing to do during the 3-hour gap between lunch and the second cooking session is what turns a great tailgate into a boring one.</p>

              <!-- Section 4: What Wins -->
              <h2 id="what-wins">What Wins</h2>
              <p>The <strong>two-phase food plan</strong> is the backbone of every successful night game tailgate. Phase one is a full lunch spread around noon: deli platters, sides, dips, chips, maybe some quick grilled items. This is the communal, easy, low-effort meal. Phase two is a proper grilling session from 4 to 5 PM: burgers, brats, chicken, whatever your crew does best. This is the meal that carries people into the stadium with full stomachs and fresh energy. Two meals, deliberately timed, with a purpose. That's the difference between thriving and surviving.</p>
              <p><strong>String lights and LED lanterns</strong> are game-changers. Battery-powered string lights draped across your canopy or between vehicles transform a dark parking lot into something that feels intentional and inviting. LED lanterns on your tables and near the grill keep things safe and functional. The visual impact is real &mdash; a well-lit setup after dark becomes a gathering spot. People gravitate toward light and warmth, and your tailgate becomes the hub of the lot. A mix of <strong>alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks with intentional pacing</strong> keeps your crew functional. Stock water, soda, and sports drinks alongside the beer and cocktails. Make it easy and socially acceptable to grab a non-alcoholic option. Some groups designate the 2-4 PM window as "hydration hours" with water and coffee as the primary options.</p>
              <p><strong>Planned activities</strong> fill the long pre-game hours and keep energy levels from cratering. A cornhole tournament with brackets, a football toss competition, card games, or a TV tuned to the early afternoon games give people something to engage with beyond just sitting and drinking. A <strong>designated late-afternoon coffee and snack run</strong> is the veteran move that most people don't think about. Around 3-4 PM, send someone for a coffee run or brew a pot on your camp stove. A round of coffee and a few snacks during the afternoon lull is often the difference between a crew that's fading and one that gets a genuine second wind.</p>

              <!-- Section 5: What Veterans Do Differently -->
              <h2 id="veterans">What Veterans Do Differently</h2>
              <p>Veterans eat a real lunch &mdash; not just snacks. They sit down, make a plate, and eat a proper meal within the first hour of arriving. They know that grazing on chips and dip for two hours isn't the same as eating a meal that includes protein, carbs, and substance. That first meal is the foundation for the entire day. Skip it or half-commit to it, and you'll feel the consequences by mid-afternoon when your energy bottoms out and you start making bad decisions about how much to drink.</p>
              <p>The smartest night-game tailgaters <strong>switch to water and soda from 2 to 4 PM</strong>. They don't announce it. They don't make a big deal about it. They just quietly hydrate and rest during the natural lull. They know the energy dip comes around 3-4 PM no matter what &mdash; it's a biological reality of being awake and active for hours in the sun. Instead of fighting it with more alcohol (which makes it worse), they ride it out with water, shade, and conversation. They have a <strong>second wave of food ready at 5 PM</strong>, timed perfectly to refuel the crew and reignite the energy before the pre-game walk to the stadium.</p>
              <p>Veterans bring <strong>battery-powered string lights</strong> because atmosphere matters. They know that a dark tailgate after sunset feels like it's over, but a lit-up tailgate feels like a new phase of the party. They plan for the cold &mdash; even in September &mdash; with a hoodie or jacket in the car for everyone in their group. They also know when to leave. The pre-game walk to the stadium at 6 PM, one hour before kickoff, gives them time to settle in, soak up the atmosphere, and be in their seats ready to go when the lights come on. They don't rush, they don't straggle, and they don't arrive at the stadium already exhausted. The entire day is designed around peaking at kickoff, not at 2 PM.</p>

              <!-- Section 6: Night Game Timeline -->
              <h2 id="timeline">Night Game Timeline</h2>
              <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
                <p class="info-box-title">Recommended Timeline &mdash; 7 PM Kickoff</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>11:00 AM &mdash; Arrive &amp; Setup.</strong> Claim your spot, set up canopy, tables, chairs, coolers, and grill. Get organized before the lot fills up. This is your foundation for the next 12 hours.</li>
                  <li><strong>12:00 PM &mdash; Lunch Spread.</strong> Put out the first meal: deli platters, sides, dips, pre-made salads, easy grilled items. Feed everyone a real lunch. This isn't snack time &mdash; it's a sit-down meal.</li>
                  <li><strong>1:00 &ndash; 3:00 PM &mdash; Games, Socializing, Moderate Drinking.</strong> This is the social peak of the early afternoon. Cornhole tournament, football toss, music playing, early games on the TV. Drinks are flowing but at a sustainable pace. Enjoy the energy without burning through it.</li>
                  <li><strong>3:00 &ndash; 4:00 PM &mdash; The Lull.</strong> Hydrate. Rest. Coffee. This is the valley every night game tailgate hits, and it's not a failure &mdash; it's biology. Sit in the shade, switch to water, grab a coffee, and let the mid-afternoon tiredness pass. Veterans embrace this hour instead of fighting it.</li>
                  <li><strong>4:00 &ndash; 5:00 PM &mdash; Second Wind Cooking.</strong> Fire up the grill for phase two. Burgers, brats, chicken &mdash; whatever your crew does best. This is the meal that carries you into the stadium. Hot food, fresh energy, and the realization that the real event is about to start.</li>
                  <li><strong>5:00 &ndash; 6:00 PM &mdash; Lights Up, Music Up, Energy Builds.</strong> String lights go on. Music volume comes up. The lot transforms as the sun drops. The temperature shifts. Jackets come out. The anticipation builds. This is the hour where a night game tailgate becomes something special.</li>
                  <li><strong>6:00 PM &mdash; Pre-Game Walk to the Stadium.</strong> Pack up what needs packing, secure your setup, and start the walk. One hour before kickoff gives you time to get through the gates, find your seats, grab anything you need, and soak up the stadium atmosphere as it fills.</li>
                  <li><strong>7:00 PM &mdash; Kickoff.</strong> You're fed, hydrated, energized, and in your seat. The lights are on. The crowd is roaring. You've been at this for seven hours and you feel like the night is just getting started. That's how you do a night game.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <!-- Section 7: The Bottom Line -->
              <h2 id="bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
              <p>Night games are the crown jewels of the tailgating calendar. The atmosphere under the lights, the energy of a prime-time crowd, the feeling of an entire day building toward something &mdash; there's nothing like it in sports. But that experience is only available to people who plan for it. The ones who treat a 12-hour day like a 4-hour one end up missing the best part.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>"Night games reward the patient and punish the eager. Pace yourself like the game depends on it &mdash; because your enjoyment of it absolutely does."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Every decision you make from noon to 7 PM is either building toward an incredible night or stealing from it. Eat two meals. Hydrate during the lull. Bring lights. Plan activities. Pack a jacket. And above all, remember that the goal of the entire day is to walk into that stadium feeling like you have more to give, not less. The parking lot is the warm-up. The stadium is the show. And the best tailgaters make sure they're ready for both.</p>
