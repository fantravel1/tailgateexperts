          <h2 id="unwritten-rules">The Unwritten Rules</h2>
          <p>No one hands you a rulebook when you pull into the lot, but the rules exist and the regulars enforce them through social pressure rather than authority. The basics: do not walk through someone else's setup. It does not matter if cutting through their canopy saves you 30 seconds. Walk around. Do not park in a way that blocks another group's established space. And if someone offers you food or a drink, accept it, say thank you, and offer something back when you can.</p>
          <p>Noise matters more than most newcomers realize. Your music is your business until it drowns out the group next to you. Keep the volume at a level where a conversation is still possible at the edge of your setup. Generator etiquette follows the same logic: run it when you need it, turn it off when you do not, and point the exhaust away from your neighbors. These are not suggestions. Violate them and you will find your lot neighbors less friendly every week.</p>
          <p>The most important unwritten rule is also the simplest: leave your spot cleaner than you found it. Bag your trash, pick up anything that blew over from someone else's site, and make sure your grill ash is fully extinguished. The lots get checked, and stadium management uses the mess left behind as justification to restrict tailgating. Every piece of trash you leave is an argument against the thing you came here to do.</p>

          <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
            <p class="info-box-title">The Neighbor Test</p>
            <p>If you would not do it in your neighbor's backyard, do not do it in the lot. The people around you come back every week. Your reputation is built one Saturday at a time.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="regional-differences">Regional Differences</h2>
          <p>Tailgating in the SEC is a different sport than tailgating in the Big Ten, and both look nothing like the NFL version. In the SEC, tailgating is aspirational. Think tablecloths, chandeliers in tents, and women in sundresses and men in ties at an 11 AM kickoff. The Grove at Ole Miss is more garden party than parking lot. LSU treats it like a culinary competition. At Alabama, the scale is industrial and the efficiency is military.</p>
          <p>Big Ten tailgating is blunter and more democratic. Wisconsin fans start with brats and beer at sunrise and build from there. Iowa's Kinnick Stadium lots run on Midwestern hospitality so aggressive that strangers will physically place a plate in your hands. Michigan's lots are sprawling and tribal, with generations of families holding the same spots. The food is hearty, the drinks are cold, and nobody cares what you are wearing.</p>
          <p>NFL tailgating operates on a different clock. Professional games mean professional fans who have streamlined their setups for maximum efficiency in minimum time. The Bills Mafia in Buffalo has turned pregame chaos into a cultural identity. Kansas City's Arrowhead lot is the standard by which all NFL tailgates are measured: organized, massive, and relentlessly committed to smoked meat. Meanwhile, teams that play in newer stadiums with limited parking, like the Chargers or Rams, have tailgate cultures still finding their identity.</p>

          <h2 id="social-contract">The Social Contract</h2>
          <p>Tailgating works because of an unspoken agreement between strangers: I will share what I have, you will share what you have, and we will all have a better day because of it. This is not charity. It is the social contract of the lot. The group next to you has bourbon but forgot cups. You have cups. The transaction takes five seconds and creates an alliance that lasts all season.</p>
          <p>This culture of mutual generosity is what separates a great tailgate lot from a parking lot where people happen to be eating. At the best venues, food and drinks flow between setups without anyone keeping score. A plate of pulled pork goes one direction. A round of Jell-O shots comes back. Nobody invoices anyone. The economy of the lot runs on goodwill, and it is remarkably efficient.</p>

          <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
            <p class="info-box-title">Always Bring Something to Share</p>
            <p>Even if you are visiting someone else's setup, bring a contribution. A six-pack, a bag of chips, a dessert. Showing up empty-handed once is fine. Showing up empty-handed twice is noticed.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>In an era where most social gatherings require a screen, a reservation, or an algorithm, tailgating remains stubbornly analog. You show up, you stand next to people, you share food cooked over actual fire, and you talk about something you all care about. There is no app for this. There is no virtual equivalent. The parking lot is one of the last public spaces in American life where strangers reliably become friends.</p>
          <p>Tailgating matters because it creates community through repetition. The same spot, the same neighbors, the same Saturday rhythm week after week. Over a season, those nods become conversations. Over a few seasons, those conversations become friendships. Over a decade, those friendships become the kind of bonds that show up at funerals and weddings, not just football games. The lot is where this starts.</p>
          <p>It also matters because it is one of the few traditions that genuinely crosses demographic lines. In the same lot you will find professors and plumbers, retirees and college students, families and friend groups, people who drove 500 miles and people who walked from their apartment. The common language is the team, the food, and the shared understanding that the hours before the game are not a prelude. They are the main event.</p>
