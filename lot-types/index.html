        <h1>Tailgate Lot Types Explained</h1>
        <p class="page-subtitle">Not all lots are created equal. Where you park determines what kind of tailgate you'll have. Here's every type, decoded.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="page-body">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="article-content">
          <h2 id="official-lots">Official Stadium Lots</h2>
          <p><strong>What they are:</strong> Lots owned and operated by the stadium or venue authority. These are the biggest, most organized, and most expensive parking options. They're usually labeled by letter or number (Lot A, Lot B, etc.) and have clearly marked spaces, attendants, and porta-potties.</p>
          <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> Prices range from $30 to $100+ depending on the stadium and proximity to the gates. Many require pre-purchase or a season parking pass — showing up on game day without a pass can mean getting turned away. Rules are more strictly enforced here: no charcoal grills at some venues, noise limits, and clear-out times. The upside is infrastructure — paved surfaces, lighting, restrooms, and proximity to the stadium entrance.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Fans who want convenience, easy stadium access, and don't mind paying for it. Season ticket holders who want a consistent spot every week.</p>

          <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
            <p class="info-box-title">Insider Move</p>
            <p>At many stadiums, the farthest official lot is also the cheapest, the most relaxed on rules, and the most fun. The premium lots near the gates are full of corporate setups. The back lots are where the real tailgaters are.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="private-lots">Private Lots</h2>
          <p><strong>What they are:</strong> Lots owned by businesses, churches, or private landowners near the stadium. They pop up on game day with hand-painted signs and someone collecting cash at the entrance. Prices vary wildly — from $10 to $60 depending on proximity and demand.</p>
          <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> Surfaces are often gravel or grass. There may be no restrooms, no lighting, and no attendants after you park. Rules are minimal — the owner just wants your money and wants you to leave after the game. This can be a blessing (freedom) or a curse (no oversight if problems arise). Some private lots have been operating for decades and have their own regular communities.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget-conscious fans who want more freedom. Groups who want to set up without restrictions. Away fans who can't get official lot passes.</p>

          <h2 id="neighborhood-lots">Neighborhood Lots &amp; Yards</h2>
          <p><strong>What they are:</strong> Residents near the stadium who open their yards, driveways, or empty lots for parking on game day. This is especially common at Lambeau Field, where the residential neighborhood surrounding the stadium becomes a massive parking operation every Sunday.</p>
          <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> The most authentic tailgate experience. You're parking in someone's yard, grilling on their grass, and often chatting with the homeowner. Prices are usually $20-40 cash. The atmosphere is relaxed, the rules are minimal, and the community feel is unmatched. Some families have been hosting fans in their yards for generations.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> First-timers who want a welcoming atmosphere. Fans who value community over convenience. Anyone who wants the "real" tailgate experience.</p>

          <h2 id="free-options">Free &amp; Public Options</h2>
          <p><strong>What they are:</strong> Public streets, campus green spaces, and free lots that don't charge for parking. At college stadiums, the campus itself often serves as free tailgate space — the Parade Ground at LSU, the Grove at Ole Miss, and various quads and commons at universities across the country.</p>
          <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> First-come, first-served. Arrive early or don't arrive at all. Free lots fill up hours before kickoff. Street parking may have time limits or game-day restrictions. Campus spaces are open but may have rules about alcohol, grills, and setup times. The trade-off for free is usually distance — you'll walk more to get to the stadium.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> No-ticket tailgaters, budget fans, and anyone who doesn't mind arriving early and walking far.</p>

          <div class="info-box info-box--warning">
            <p class="info-box-title">Heads Up</p>
            <p>Free street parking near stadiums is a tow-risk zone on game days. Many cities designate game-day no-parking zones that aren't clearly signed until the morning of. Check local regulations before you leave your car on a random street.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="rv-lots">RV &amp; Overnight Lots</h2>
          <p><strong>What they are:</strong> Designated areas for RVs and oversized vehicles, often with overnight access. These are the domain of the most serious tailgaters — the ones who arrive Friday and don't leave until Sunday. Prices range from $75 to $200+ and typically require pre-purchase.</p>
          <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> Power hookups at some venues, but don't count on it. Water access is rare. You're self-contained. The community in RV lots is tight — these are regulars who've been parking next to each other for years. The food quality in RV lots is typically the highest because people have full kitchens and all day to cook.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Dedicated tailgaters who want the ultimate experience. Groups willing to invest in a full weekend. Fans who own or rent RVs and want to make game day an event.</p>
