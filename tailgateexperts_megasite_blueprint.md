## 1) Core Reframe (Lock This In)

**Tailgating Is a Skill.**

Everything on the site reinforces that:

- You don’t “wing it”
- You don’t “hack it”
- You **learn it, earn it, and respect it**

This immediately separates TailgateExperts from:
- blogs
- recipe sites
- frat energy
- brand spam

You’re positioning like:

> *“We’ve been doing this longer than you’ve been watching this team.”*

That’s it.  
Everything else fans find *inside*.
