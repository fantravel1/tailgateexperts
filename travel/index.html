          <h2 id="road-trip-equation">The Road Trip Equation</h2>
          <p>Every away game starts with the same question: do we drive or fly? The math is simpler than most people make it. If the stadium is within five hours, driving is almost always the right call. You keep your gear, you control your schedule, and you skip the rental car circus. Beyond five hours, the calculation shifts, but not always toward the airport.</p>
          <p>Driving with a crew of four changes everything. Split gas four ways and a 600-mile road trip costs less per person than a single checked bag fee. You arrive with your grill, your cooler, and your canopy already packed. Flying means renting gear, borrowing setups, or showing up empty-handed and hoping someone nearby is generous. For serious tailgaters, that is not a plan.</p>
          <p>The hidden variable is time. A Friday departure with a Monday return gives you breathing room. A same-day flight forces you into a sprint: land, Uber, tailgate, game, Uber, fly home. You can do it, but you will feel every minute. The best road-trip crews leave Thursday night, split the drive, and arrive Friday with a full day to explore the city before the lot opens Saturday morning.</p>

          <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
            <p class="info-box-title">The 5-Hour Rule</p>
            <p>Under five hours of drive time? Take the car. You will save money, keep your gear, and arrive on your own schedule. Over eight hours? Fly and plan to borrow or rent a setup on site.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="hotels-that-work">Hotels That Work</h2>
          <p>Proximity to the stadium is the only metric that matters, and most travel sites do not optimize for it. A hotel two miles from the lot with a free shuttle beats a downtown boutique property every time. You want to walk to the tailgate, not negotiate surge pricing at 8 AM on game day. Search by distance from the stadium, not by neighborhood name.</p>
          <p>Booking timing matters more than most fans realize. Hotels near major college stadiums often sell out months in advance for marquee matchups. SEC rivalry weekends and playoff-caliber games can double or triple normal rates. The move is to book refundable rates as soon as the schedule drops, then adjust later. Waiting until the week before is how you end up at a motel 40 minutes away paying $300 a night.</p>
          <p>Look for hotels that cater to game-day crowds. Some properties near stadiums allow tailgating in their own parking lots. Others offer early check-in for Saturday games and late checkout on Sunday. A few even run shuttle loops to the stadium. These details rarely show up on booking sites, so call the hotel directly and ask what they do for game weekends.</p>

          <h2 id="rv-logistics">RV Logistics</h2>
          <p>RV tailgating is the pinnacle of the craft, but it comes with a logistics layer that casual fans underestimate. The first question is always parking: not every stadium allows RVs in the main lots, and those that do often require advance reservations that open months before the season. At places like Arrowhead and Tiger Stadium, RV spots are generational assets passed down like season tickets.</p>
          <p>Power hookups are rare. Most stadium RV lots are dry camping, which means you are running on your generator and your battery bank. Plan your power budget: the grill does not need electricity, but the TV, the blender, and the string lights do. A quiet-running inverter generator in the 2,000-3,000 watt range handles most tailgate setups without turning your neighbors against you.</p>

          <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
            <p class="info-box-title">Overnight Rules Vary Wildly</p>
            <p>Some stadiums allow Friday-night RV arrivals. Others open lots at 6 AM on game day. A few allow post-game overnight stays. Always confirm the specific stadium's RV policy before you commit to a 10-hour drive.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="away-game-weekends">Away Game Weekends</h2>
          <p>The best away-game trips are not just about the game. They are about building an entire weekend around a destination. Arrive Friday, explore the local food scene, visit campus landmarks, and find the bars where home fans and visitors actually mix. The tailgate on Saturday becomes the centerpiece of a full travel experience, not a frantic dash from airport to stadium.</p>
          <p>Budget the weekend honestly. Game tickets, hotel, gas or flights, food, parking, and incidentals add up fast. A realistic away-game weekend for two people runs $500 to $1,200 depending on the matchup and the market. Plan for it. The fans who go broke on one trip and skip the rest of the season had the wrong strategy from the start.</p>
          <p>Travel in groups when you can. Four people splitting a hotel room, gas, and a parking pass spend dramatically less per person than a solo traveler. Coordinate with your crew early, lock in commitments, and designate one person to handle logistics. The best away-game weekends are organized, not improvised.</p>
