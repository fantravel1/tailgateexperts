          <h2 id="nfl">NFL Tailgating</h2>
          <p>NFL tailgating is a Sunday ritual built around massive stadium-owned parking lots, expensive passes, and a more structured experience. The lots are paved, the rules are enforced (to a degree), and the crowd skews older and more established. This isn't a knock — NFL tailgates produce some of the best food and most elaborate setups in the country. Arrowhead, Lambeau, and the Bills' lots in Orchard Park are legendary for a reason.</p>
          <p>The trade-off is cost and access. NFL parking passes can run $40-100 per game, and many lots require season-long commitments. The tailgate window is tighter — lots typically open 3-4 hours before kickoff and clear out faster after the game. But within that window, the intensity is unmatched. These are fans who've been doing this every Sunday for decades.</p>
          <p><strong>Key differences:</strong> Higher cost, more infrastructure, stricter rules, shorter windows, established communities in specific lot sections, and food quality that rivals restaurants.</p>

          <h2 id="college-football">College Football Tailgating</h2>
          <p>College tailgating is a different animal entirely. The lots are less organized but more open. Campus quads, residential streets, fraternity lawns, and open fields all become tailgate zones. The energy skews younger, the alcohol flows more freely, and the traditions run deeper. At LSU, Ole Miss, and Wisconsin, tailgating isn't something you do before the game — it IS the game day experience.</p>
          <p>College tailgating is more accessible. Parking is cheaper or free. Campus is public. You don't need a ticket to participate. The atmosphere is more welcoming to strangers — walking up to a random tailgate and being offered food is not unusual, it's expected. The regional food culture is more pronounced: Cajun cooking at LSU, bratwurst at Wisconsin, BBQ at Texas.</p>
          <p><strong>Key differences:</strong> Lower cost, more open access, longer tailgate windows (all-day affairs for night games), stronger regional food identity, younger crowds, and traditions that have been running for 50+ years.</p>

            <p class="info-box-title">The Verdict</p>
            <p>NFL tailgating is a polished machine. College tailgating is a beautiful mess. Both are worth experiencing. If you can only pick one trip this year, go to a Saturday night SEC game. If you want to see what peak food culture looks like, hit Arrowhead on a Sunday.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="other-sports">Beyond Football</h2>
          <p>Tailgating exists outside football, but it's a different experience. NASCAR races feature some of the longest and most elaborate tailgate setups in American sports — infield camping at Talladega or Daytona is a multi-day event with RVs, generators, and full outdoor kitchens. The culture is less about the lot and more about the campground.</p>
          <p>Baseball tailgating exists but is less common — the 81-game home schedule means fewer "event" games. Soccer (MLS) tailgating is growing, especially at dedicated soccer stadiums where supporter groups organize pre-match parties. Hockey tailgating happens in cold-weather cities but is limited by arena parking constraints and weather.</p>
          <p>The truth is, football owns tailgating. The weekly rhythm of one game per week (NFL) or six home games per season (college) creates scarcity that drives intensity. When you only get 8-10 chances per year, every tailgate matters.</p>
