        <h1>Food That Wins Games</h1>
        <p class="page-subtitle">This isn't a recipe site. Tailgate food is logistics — what scales, what survives, what you can finish onsite, and what feeds strangers without awkwardness. Nobody remembers your secret sauce. They remember that you fed them.</p>
      </div>

          <h2 id="feeding-crowds">Feeding 20 People Without Stress</h2>
          <p>The best large-group tailgate foods are those that scale without complicating your setup. You're not running a restaurant — you're feeding a crowd in a parking lot with one grill and a folding table. The goal is volume, simplicity, and zero stress.</p>
          <p><strong>What works at scale:</strong> Pulled pork sliders (cook the pork at home the night before, reheat in a crockpot on-site). Brats and hot dogs — they're fast, cheap, and everyone eats them. A big batch of chili that stays warm for hours. Loaded nachos with pre-portioned toppings. Pre-made pasta salad that doesn't need refrigeration timing.</p>
          <p><strong>What doesn't scale:</strong> Anything that requires precise timing or multiple cooking stages. Steaks for 20 people. Anything with raw eggs or dairy sitting in heat. Complicated marinades that need last-minute prep. If it takes longer to explain than to eat, it doesn't belong at a tailgate.</p>

          <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
            <p class="info-box-title">The Golden Rule</p>
            <p>Make extra. Always. The best tailgaters feed strangers without thinking twice. That extra tray of sliders is how you build a reputation in the lot.</p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="heat-survival">Food That Survives Heat &amp; Travel</h2>
          <p>September games in the South mean 90&deg;F+ and direct sun. Your food strategy needs to account for heat from the moment it leaves your kitchen to the moment it hits a plate in the lot. The window between "safe" and "sketchy" is shorter than you think.</p>
          <p><strong>Heat-proof winners:</strong> Chips and shelf-stable dips (salsa, hummus in sealed containers on ice). Pre-marinated meats in sealed bags directly on ice. Watermelon, grapes, and fruit that doesn't brown. Bean salads and pasta salads with vinaigrette dressing (not mayo). Jerky and trail mix. Anything that goes directly from cooler to grill with no in-between.</p>
          <p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Mayo-based salads (potato salad, coleslaw sitting in sun). Cut avocado. Anything that wilts — lettuce-based salads, delicate herbs. Cream cheese dips without a cold source. Sushi. If it would make a health inspector nervous, leave it home.</p>

          <h2 id="regional-food">Regional Tailgate Food Culture</h2>
          <p>The food at a tailgate tells you exactly where you are. At Arrowhead, it's brisket and burnt ends. At Lambeau, it's bratwurst and cheese curds. At LSU, it's jambalaya, crawfish, and boudin. Respecting the local food culture isn't optional — it's how you show you belong.</p>
          <p>This doesn't mean you can't bring your own specialties. It means you should know what the standard is before you try to reinvent it. Showing up to a Kansas City tailgate with a microwave is a crime. Bringing a deep fryer to Baton Rouge is a sign of respect.</p>

          <h2 id="cleanup">The Cleanup Rule</h2>
          <p>Your food strategy isn't complete until your trash is bagged, your grill is cool, and your spot is cleaner than you found it. The fans who return every week notice who trashes the lot — and they remember. Bring heavy-duty trash bags. Bring aluminum foil for grill cleanup. Bring paper towels by the roll, not the sheet.</p>
