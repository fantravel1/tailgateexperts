            <p class="section-lead">Tailgating is the pre-game tradition of gathering in stadium parking lots to eat, drink, socialize, and celebrate before a sporting event. But calling it a "tradition" undersells it. <strong>Tailgating is a skill</strong> — one you learn, earn, and respect over time.</p>
            <p>For first-timers, the basics are simple: arrive 3&ndash;4 hours before kickoff, find your spot in the lot, set up your cooking and seating area, and connect with fellow fans. The deeper truth is that tailgating is a community. You don't crash it. You don't fake it. You learn the rhythms, respect the veterans, and bring something to share.</p>
            <p>Whether you're feeding 5 friends or 50 strangers, grilling brats in a blizzard or watching the sunset before a night game, tailgating rewards preparation, generosity, and showing up with the right energy.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Tailgating is the pre-game tradition of gathering in stadium parking lots to eat, drink, socialize, and celebrate before a sporting event. For first-timers, it works like this: arrive 3&ndash;4 hours before kickoff, find your spot in the lot, set up your cooking and seating area, and connect with fellow fans. The key is understanding that tailgating is a community — not a party you crash, but a culture you join with respect, contribution, and genuine enthusiasm.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Essential first-time tailgate items include: a quality cooler with plenty of ice, drinks for everyone (beer, water, soda), easy-to-share food (burgers, brats, chips, dips), a portable grill, folding chairs, paper plates and utensils, napkins, trash bags, sunscreen, and a positive attitude. The golden rule: bring enough to share with at least two strangers. That generosity is your introduction to the community.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The top stadiums for tailgating include Arrowhead Stadium (Kansas City Chiefs), Lambeau Field (Green Bay Packers), Tiger Stadium at LSU, The Grove at Ole Miss, Soldier Field (Chicago Bears), and Michigan Stadium. Each offers a unique tailgate culture with different strengths — from LSU's legendary Cajun cooking to Lambeau's neighborhood brat-and-beer atmosphere. Our Tailgate Score&trade; system rates each stadium across 8 metrics so you can find your perfect match.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>For a noon kickoff, arrive 3&ndash;4 hours early (8&ndash;9 AM). For afternoon games, arrive by late morning. For night games, plan on arriving 4&ndash;5 hours before kickoff — these are marathons. At legendary tailgate stadiums like Arrowhead and LSU, hardcore fans arrive 6+ hours before kickoff. Our stadium-specific guides give exact timing recommendations based on lot location, game time, and rival matchups.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Absolutely. Many of the most dedicated tailgaters never enter the stadium. Tailgating is its own event — you can watch the game on a portable TV, listen on the radio, or simply enjoy the food and community. Most parking lots do not require a game ticket to enter, though some premium or stadium-adjacent lots may. For budget-conscious fans, locals, and social fans, tailgate-only game days are a long-standing tradition.</p>

            <summary class="faq-question">What is the best tailgate food for feeding 20 people?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The best large-group tailgate foods are those that scale without complicating your setup: pulled pork sliders (cook ahead, reheat on-site), brats and hot dogs (fast and simple on the grill), a big batch of chili in a crockpot, loaded nachos with pre-made toppings, and pre-made pasta salad. Avoid anything that requires precise timing, multiple cooking stages, or ingredients that spoil quickly in heat. The goal is feeding people, not impressing a food critic.</p>

            <summary class="faq-question">How do you join another tailgate without being awkward?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The respectful approach: bring a contribution (a six-pack, a side dish, or dessert), walk up with a smile, introduce yourself, and compliment their setup. Read the room — match the energy level. Don't take food without being offered, don't overstay your welcome (20&ndash;30 minutes is the sweet spot for strangers), and always say thank you before moving on. Most tailgaters love welcoming newcomers who show genuine respect and come bearing gifts.</p>

            <summary class="faq-question">What do cops actually enforce at tailgates?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Enforcement varies dramatically by stadium and even by lot. In general, police focus on: underage drinking (consistently enforced everywhere), fights and aggressive behavior, illegal substances, blocking fire lanes, and noise complaints from nearby residents. Grilling rules, alcohol container types, and generator policies are often technically on the books but rarely enforced unless you're causing problems. Our stadium guides detail what officers actually care about at each venue.</p>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary class="faq-question">What grills are allowed at tailgates?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Most stadiums officially allow propane grills. In practice, charcoal grills are used widely at the majority of venues despite sometimes being technically prohibited. Key rules that are actually enforced: no grilling on grass or landscaped areas, no leaving hot coals on pavement, and proper disposal of ash. Some stadiums restrict grill size. Check our stadium-specific guides for exact policies and what's actually tolerated at each venue.</p>

            <summary class="faq-question">What's the difference between the family lot and the wild lot?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The family lot features kid-friendly activities, potluck-style food sharing, cornhole tournaments, and PG-rated conversation. The wild lot features loud music, intense energy, body paint, shotgunning, and a party atmosphere that's not suitable for children. Both exist at most stadiums. Neither is wrong — they're just different experiences. Know which one you're parking in before you unload, especially if you're bringing kids or visiting fans.</p>
