              <h2 id="why-it-works">Why No-Ticket Tailgating Works</h2>
              <p>Here's a truth that stadium marketers don't want you to hear: the parking lot is often better than the game itself. The energy, the food, the community — it all happens outside. And plenty of veterans with decades of tailgating experience will tell you that some of their best game days ended without ever scanning a ticket.</p>
              <p>No-ticket tailgating isn't freeloading. It's a legitimate way to experience game day, especially when ticket prices have climbed past what most families can afford every week. A single NFL ticket can run $150-400. A full tailgate setup for four people? Maybe $60 in food and drinks. The math speaks for itself.</p>

              <h2 id="is-it-allowed">Is It Actually Allowed?</h2>
              <p>The short answer: it depends on the venue, but at most stadiums, yes. Most parking lots don't check for game tickets — you're paying for a parking spot, not admission. Once you've paid for parking, you have as much right to be there as anyone else. The lot is not the stadium.</p>
              <p>That said, some venues have started cracking down. A few NFL stadiums now require a game ticket to purchase parking. College campuses are generally more open — campus is public land, and the Parade Ground at LSU doesn't care if you have a ticket. Always check the specific stadium's policy before you go.</p>

              <div class="info-box info-box--tip">
                <p class="info-box-title">Pro Tip</p>
                <p>Even at stadiums that require a ticket for official lots, there are almost always private lots, neighborhood yards, and off-site options nearby that don't check. The tailgate finds a way.</p>
              </div>

              <h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to Do It Right</h2>
              <p><strong>Bring value.</strong> If you're joining someone else's tailgate without a ticket, bring food, drinks, or supplies. Nobody minds a no-ticket fan who shows up with a case of beer and a plate of wings. Everyone minds the person who shows up empty-handed and eats someone else's food.</p>
              <p><strong>Have a plan for kickoff.</strong> When the lot empties out at game time, you'll need somewhere to go. The best options: a nearby sports bar with outdoor seating, your own setup with a portable TV or radio, or simply enjoying the quiet lot with your crew. Some fans prefer the post-exodus calm — the lot is yours, the food is still warm, and you can hear yourself think.</p>
              <p><strong>Don't overstay.</strong> If you're in a private or neighborhood lot, respect the timeline. Stadium lots will start clearing you out after the game. Neighborhood lots have neighbors who want their street back. Read the room and leave graciously.</p>

              <div class="info-box info-box--warning">
                <p class="info-box-title">Watch Out</p>
                <p>Some lots will tow after a certain hour, especially private lots near NFL stadiums. Know the rules before you settle in for a full day.</p>
              </div>

              <h2 id="best-stadiums">Best Stadiums for No-Ticket Tailgating</h2>
              <p>College stadiums are generally more no-ticket friendly than NFL venues. The open campus culture means there's more public space, fewer ticket checks, and a more welcoming attitude toward anyone who shows up ready to participate.</p>
              <p><strong>Top picks:</strong> LSU (the Parade Ground is open to everyone), Ole Miss (The Grove doesn't check tickets), Wisconsin (the area around Camp Randall is a free-for-all), and Penn State (Happy Valley welcomes all). For NFL, Arrowhead and Lambeau are the most welcoming — the lots are community spaces, not corporate checkpoints.</p>

              <h2 id="watching-the-game">Watching the Game Without Going In</h2>
              <p>Portable TVs and tablets with a streaming subscription are the modern solution. A 12-inch portable TV with a digital antenna picks up local games for free. A phone hotspot and a streaming app covers the rest. Add a portable speaker for audio and you've got a setup that rivals the nosebleeds — with better food.</p>
              <p>The other option: walk to the nearest sports bar at kickoff. In college towns especially, the bars within walking distance of the stadium are part of the game day experience. They're packed, they're loud, and they're significantly cheaper than a ticket. Get there 15 minutes before kickoff to claim a spot.</p>
